## 📌 Introduction

The **Inventory Management System** is a DevOps-based academic project designed to demonstrate how a real-world application is developed, version-controlled, built, and managed using modern DevOps tools.

The project consists of:
- A **frontend** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- A **backend** developed using Java Spring Boot and Maven  
- Proper **Git version control** with multiple branches and commits  

This project highlights **DevOps concepts like branching, commits, build automation, and integration**.
